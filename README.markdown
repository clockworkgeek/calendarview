About
-----------

This is a fork of CalendarView by Justin Mecham who had guts to create a calendar 
written in modern and readable javascript using Prototype.

* CalendarView  on GitHub: http://wiki.github.com/jsmecham/calendarview/tree
* CalendarView site: calendarview.org.

Look at the original README in file README.original.markdown

The differences from the original are

* Support for time in the form of two dropdowns for hours and minutes. Can be turned off/on.
* Draggable popup calendars (which introduces new dependancies: script.aculo.us effects.js and dragdrop.js)
* Close button
* Popup calendars  are not created every time they pop up, on the contrary, they are created once just like
  embedded calendars, and then shown or hidden.
* Possible to have many popup calendars on page. The behavior of the original calendarview when a popup 
  calendar is hidden when the user clicks elsewhere on the page is an option now.
* Refactoring and changes to the OO design like getting rid of Calendar.prototype in favor of class based 
  OO provided by OO, and getting rid of Calendar.setup({}) in favor of a simple object constructor new Calendar({}).


Usage
-----------

To create a calendar create an instance of class Calendar:


      new Calendar({
         dateField: 'embeddedDateField',
         parentElement: 'embeddedCalendar',
         withTime: true
      });
  
Acceptable options are:

* parentElement - DOM id of the element where the calendar will appear. This calendar will always be visible on page. If this option
  is missing, the calendar is a popup caledar.
* triggerElement - DOM id of the element clicking on which will show the popup calendar.
* dateField - DOM id of the element with date and optionally time. This element can be both an INPIT element or just a DIV or a SPAN. 
  When initializing the calendar tries to parse the contents of the element (or value of the INPUT field) and if it's successful, 
  the calendar will show the date/time. The element is updated when the user changes date/time of the calendar.
* withTime - can be true or false, when true, the calendar shows two dropdown boxes for hours and minutes.
* dateFormat - format of the date or date and time. By default for a calendar without time %Y-%m-%d is used, for a calendar with time
  %Y-%m-%d %H:%M is used. If you provide this option make sure whether it has or doesn't have the time format according to option withTime.
* hideOnClickOnDay - can be true or false. If true, the popup calendar will hide once the user clicks of a day. The default is false.
* hideOnClickElsewhere - can be true or false. If true, the popup calendar will hide once the user clicks elsewhere in the page. 
  The default is false.
* minuteStep - step between values in the minute dropdown, for example, if the step is 5, the dropdown contain values 0, 5, 10, and so on.
  The default is 5.
